**Opioid Precision Launches: A New Standard for Inpatient Safety and Clinical Decision Support**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA** — **December 22, 2025** — Today marks the launch of **Opioid Precision**, a cutting-edge mobile application designed to assist hospitalists, critical care nurses, and pharmacists in navigating the complex decisions surrounding inpatient opioid management.

In an environment where calculation errors or oversight can have life-threatening consequences, Opioid Precision offers a "Swiss Army Knife" of safety tools right in the clinician's pocket.

### Key Features
*   **Intelligent Risk Assessment:** Using the PRODIGY score and custom clinical logic, the app stratifies patients by respiratory depression risk.
*   **Dynamic Equianalgesic Calculator:** Far more than a simple multiplication table, our calculator accounts for cross-tolerance reduction, breakthrough dosing guidelines, and total 24-hour safety caps.
*   **Pharmacology Reference:** Quick access to onset, peak, and duration profiles for common IV and PO formulations.

### Availability & Pricing
**Opioid Precision** is available immediately for iOS.

*   **Free Forever:** The Core Clinical Suite, including the Risk Stratification engine, Safety Checklists, and the Equianalgesic Calculator, is completely free for all healthcare professionals. We believe safety tools should be accessible to everyone at the bedside.
*   **Clinical Pathways Upgrade ($5.00):** For advanced users, an optional "Clinical Pathways" module is available as a one-time in-app purchase. This unlocks specialized protocol libraries for complex scenarios such as PCA management, palliative sedation, and difficult pain rotations.

### About the Developer
Developed by Dan Bergholz, Opioid Precision was built to bridge the gap between static textbook tables and the dynamic reality of patient care.
