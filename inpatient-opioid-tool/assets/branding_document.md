# Opioid Precision: Brand Identity Guidelines

![Opioid Precision Icon](./app_icon_medical_precision.png)

## 1. Brand Overview
**Name:** Opioid Precision  
**Tagline:** Precision Safety for Clinical Care.  
**Mission:** To equip inpatient clinicians with a modern, fast, and safety-centric tool for managing opioid therapy. We replace outdated paper tables with intelligent, context-aware precision.

## 2. Visual Identity

### App Icon
The icon features a stylized medical cross intersected by a dynamic pulse/wave within a glass-like capsule element. 
-   **Symbolism:** The cross represents traditional care; the wave represents real-time monitoring; the capsule represents the core subject matter (pharmacology).
-   **Style:** High-gloss, "Glassmorphism," Rounded (Apple iOS spec).

### Color Palette
Our palette is chosen to convey calmness, clinical cleanliness, and urgent safety alerts without inducing alarm fatigue.

| Color Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Precision Teal** | `#0d9488` | Primary Actions, Active States, Success |
| **Clinical Slate** | `#64748b` | Secondary Text, Borders, Neutral UI Elements |
| **Safety Blue** | `#2563eb` | Information, Advisories, Calculations |
| **Alert Rose** | `#e11d48` | Contraindications, High Risk Warnings, "Unsafe" |
| **Background** | `#f8fafc` | App Background (Off-white/Slate-50) |

### Typography
**Font Family:** System Default San-Serif (SF Pro / Inter).
-   **Usage:** Clean, legible, and native-feeling.
-   **Weights:** Heavy use of **Bold** for values and headers; *Regular* for explanatory text. Uppercase `text-xs` used for labels to maintain structure.

## 3. UI/UX Philosophy
1.  **Safety First:** Warnings and contraindications are always red and prominent.
2.  **Native Feel:** The app allows content to breathe, uses native momentum scrolling, and respects device safe areas.
3.  **One-Handed Utility:** Navigation is bottom-heavy for easy thumb access on mobile rounds.
4.  **Glassmorphism:** Navigation elements use partially transparent blurred backgrounds (`backdrop-blur`) to maintain context and a modern, premium aesthetic.

## 4. Tone of Voice
-   **Professional:** "Hemodynamically Stable" vs "Blood pressure is good".
-   **Direct:** "Reduce dose 50%" vs "You might want to lower the dose".
-   **Supportive:** "Consult Pain Specialist" is a tool, not a failure.
